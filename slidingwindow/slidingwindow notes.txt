**Quick Answer:**  
The **sliding window algorithm** is a technique used to efficiently process contiguous sequences (subarrays or substrings) by maintaining a "window" that moves step by step across the data. Instead of recalculating everything from scratch, the algorithm updates results incrementally as the window slides. There are two main types: **fixed-size windows** and **variable-size windows**.

## 🔎 Sliding Window Algorithm Explained
- **Core Idea:**  
  Imagine you want to analyze every segment of length `k` in an array. A naive approach would recalculate sums or checks for each segment, costing \(O(n \cdot k)\). The sliding window technique reduces this to \(O(n)\) by reusing previous computations.
  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Start with an initial window (a subset of elements).  
  - As you move the window forward, remove the effect of the element leaving and add the effect of the new element entering.  
  - Continue until the window has traversed the entire array or string.

## 📊 Types of Sliding Window

| Type | Description | Example Problems | Complexity Benefit |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Fixed-size window** | Window size `k` is constant. You slide across the array, maintaining sums, counts, or other metrics. | Maximum sum of subarray of size `k`, moving average, Defuse the Bomb (LeetCode 1652). | Reduces from \(O(n \cdot k)\) to \(O(n)\). |
| **Variable-size window** | Window size changes dynamically based on conditions (expand or shrink). | Longest substring without repeating characters, smallest subarray with sum ≥ target. | Avoids nested loops, reduces from \(O(n^2)\) to \(O(n)\). |

## 🧪 Examples You Can Show Trainees
1. **Fixed-size:**  
   - Find the maximum sum of any subarray of length 3.  
   - Instead of summing each subarray separately, keep a rolling sum and update as the window slides.

2. **Variable-size:**  
   - Find the longest substring without repeating characters.  
   - Expand the window until a duplicate appears, then shrink from the left until the condition is satisfied.

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Teaching Notes
- **Common mistake:** Forgetting to update both ends of the window correctly.  
- **Trade-off:** Sliding window works only for problems involving contiguous segments. For non-contiguous subsequences, other techniques (like DP) are needed.  
- **Teaching tip:** Start with a brute-force nested loop solution, then show how sliding window eliminates redundant work.

## ✅ Conclusion
The **sliding window algorithm** is a powerful optimization technique for contiguous sequence problems.  
- **Fixed-size windows** are best for problems with a strict segment length.  
- **Variable-size windows** are best when conditions dictate how far the window expands or shrinks.  

This makes it a versatile tool in both **array** and **string** problems, and a great concept to teach trainees for interview preparation and real-world efficiency.
