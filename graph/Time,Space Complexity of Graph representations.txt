Perfect, let’s analyze the **time and space complexity** of graph representations using both **Adjacency Matrix** and **Adjacency List**. I’ll take a simple example graph and then generalize.

---

## 📊 Example Graph
Let’s say we have a graph with:
- \(V = 4\) vertices
- \(E = 4\) edges: (0–1), (0–2), (1–2), (2–3)

We’ll compare how this graph is represented in **Adjacency Matrix** vs **Adjacency List**.

---

## 🧩 Adjacency Matrix
- Representation: A \(V \times V\) 2D array.
- Space Complexity:
  - Always \(O(V^2)\), regardless of number of edges.
  - Even if the graph is sparse (few edges), the matrix still stores all possible pairs.
- Time Complexity:
  - **Add edge**: \(O(1)\) → just set `matrix[i][j] = 1`.
  - **Remove edge**: \(O(1)\).
  - **Check if edge exists**: \(O(1)\).
  - **Iterate over neighbors of a vertex**: \(O(V)\) → must scan entire row.

---

## 🧩 Adjacency List
- Representation: An array/list of size \(V\), where each entry stores a list of neighbors.
- Space Complexity:
  - \(O(V + E)\).
  - Much more efficient for sparse graphs (when \(E \ll V^2\)).
- Time Complexity:
  - **Add edge**: \(O(1)\) → append to list.
  - **Remove edge**: \(O(\deg(v))\) → need to search neighbor list.
  - **Check if edge exists**: \(O(\deg(v))\).
  - **Iterate over neighbors of a vertex**: \(O(\deg(v))\) → only scan actual neighbors.

## ⚖️ Comparison Table

| Operation                  | Adjacency Matrix | Adjacency List |
|-----------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Space**                  | \(O(V^2)\)       | \(O(V + E)\)   |
| **Add edge**               | \(O(1)\)         | \(O(1)\)       |
| **Remove edge**            | \(O(1)\)         | \(O(\deg(v))\) |
| **Check edge existence**   | \(O(1)\)         | \(O(\deg(v))\) |
| **Iterate neighbors**      | \(O(V)\)         | \(O(\deg(v))\) |

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Adjacency Matrix** is better when:
  - Graph is **dense** (close to \(V^2\) edges).
  - You need **fast edge lookups**.
- **Adjacency List** is better when:
  - Graph is **sparse** (few edges).
  - You need to **iterate neighbors efficiently**.

---

👉 So, for our example graph (\(V=4, E=4\)):
- **Matrix space** = \(4^2 = 16\) cells.
- **List space** = \(V + E = 8\) entries.
- Clearly, adjacency list is more space-efficient here.

Would you like me to also **analyze BFS/DFS traversal complexity** on both representations? That’s where the difference becomes even more practical.
