Perfect 👍 — let’s enrich the **Health Metrics Calculator HackerRank challenge** by explicitly including the **formulas for BMI, BMR, and IBW** in the problem statement. This way, your trainees not only practice **encapsulation, constructor overloading, method overloading, and menu‑driven programs**, but also understand the **domain logic** behind the calculations.

## 🏥 HackerRank Challenge: Health Metrics Calculator

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a **Health Metrics Calculator** for patients.  
The system should allow a user to calculate:

- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**  
- **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**  
- **IBW (Ideal Body Weight)**  

Your program must demonstrate:  
- **Encapsulation** → private fields with getters/setters.  
- **Constructor Overloading** → initialize patient with default values or with user‑provided values.  
- **Method Overloading** → calculation methods should be overloaded where appropriate.  
- **Menu‑Driven Program** → use switch‑case to let the user choose which metric to calculate.  

---

### Formula Reference (for trainees)

BMI = 	
mass (kg)
height2 (m)
 = 	
72.57
1.7782
 = 23.0


- **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate):**  
  - For males:  
    \[
    BMR = 10 \times \text{Weight (kg)} + 6.25 \times \text{Height (cm)} - 5 \times \text{Age} + 5
    \]  
  - For females:  
    \[
    BMR = 10 \times \text{Weight (kg)} + 6.25 \times \text{Height (cm)} - 5 \times \text{Age} - 161
    \]

- **IBW (Ideal Body Weight) — Devine Formula:**  
  - For males:  
    \[
    IBW = 50 + 2.3 \times (\text{Height (inches)} - 60)
    \]  
  - For females:  
    \[
    IBW = 45.5 + 2.3 \times (\text{Height (inches)} - 60)
    \]

---

### Input Format
- First line: Patient’s name (string)  
- Second line: Age (integer)  
- Third line: Gender (`M` or `F`)  
- Fourth line: Weight in kilograms (double)  
- Fifth line: Height in centimeters (double)  
- Sixth line: Operation choice (`BMI`, `BMR`, `IBW`, or `Report`)  

---

### Output Format
- For `BMI`: Print `"BMI: X.YZ"`  
- For `BMR`: Print `"BMR: X.YZ kcal/day"`  
- For `IBW`: Print `"Ideal Body Weight: X.YZ kg"`  
- For `Report`: Print all three metrics in a formatted report.  

---

### Constraints
- `1 <= age <= 120`  
- `30 <= heightCm <= 250`  
- `2 <= weightKg <= 300`  
- Gender must be `M` or `F`.

✨ Now the challenge explicitly teaches **the formulas** along with the coding concepts.  
Would you like me to prepare **another vertical (e.g., Hospital or Library)** in the same HackerRank format, also with formulas relevant to that domain (like consultation charges or late fees)?



Slug: logistics-shipment-management
Perfect 👍 — let’s design a **Logistics vertical HackerRank‑style coding challenge** that emphasizes:

- **Encapsulation** (private fields + getters/setters)  
- **Constructor Overloading** (default and parameterized constructors)  
- **Method Overloading** (mandatory: booking shipments with different parameter sets)  
- **Menu‑Driven Program** (switch‑case for user choice)  
- **No arrays or collections** (just a single shipment object at a time)  

---

## 🚚 HackerRank Challenge: Logistics Shipment Calculator

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a **Logistics Shipment Calculator** for a courier company.  
The system should allow a customer to manage a single shipment and calculate charges.  

Your program must demonstrate:  
- **Encapsulation** → private fields with getters/setters.  
- **Constructor Overloading** → initialize shipment with default values or with user‑provided values.  
- **Method Overloading** → booking can be done either by weight alone or by weight + destination.  
- **Menu‑Driven Program** → use switch‑case to let the user choose operations.  

---

### Formula Reference (for trainees)

- **Shipment Charges:**  
  \[
  \text{Charges} = \text{Weight (kg)} \times 50
  \]  
- **Heavy Package Handling Fee:**  
  If weight > 10 kg, add ₹200 extra.  

---

### Input Format
- First line: Customer name (string)  
- Second line: Operation choice (`Book`, `Cancel`, `Charges`, `Report`)  
- If `Book`: next line contains shipment weight (double). Optionally, another line contains destination (string).  
- If `Cancel`: next line contains shipment ID (integer).  
- If `Charges`: next 3 lines contain shipment weights (double).  
- If `Report`: print details of the current shipment.  

---

### Output Format
- For `Book`:  
  - `"Shipment booked: ID 1, Weight X kg"`  
  - or `"Shipment booked: ID 1, Weight X kg, Destination Y"`  
- For `Cancel`: `"Shipment ID 1 cancelled"` or `"Shipment not found"`  
- For `Charges`: `"Total Charges: Z"`  
- For `Report`: Print shipment details if active, else `"No active shipment"`  

---

### Constraints
- Only one shipment can be active at a time.  
- Shipment ID is always `1` for simplicity.  
- Charges = weight × 50 (+200 if weight > 10 kg).  

---

### Sample Input 1
```
Alice
Book
12
Chennai
```

### Sample Output 1
```
Shipment booked: ID 1, Weight 12.0 kg, Destination Chennai
```

---

### Sample Input 2
```
Bob
Charges
5
12
8
```

### Sample Output 2
```
Total Charges: 1350.0
```

The system should allow a logistics company to analyze shipment weights.  

Your program must demonstrate:  
- **Interface** → define a method for calculating the average shipment weight.  
- **Abstract Class** → define an abstract method for displaying all shipments and a concrete method for filtering shipments heavier than a threshold.  
- **Inheritance** → extend the abstract class and implement the interface.  
- **Overriding** → provide concrete implementations for abstract/interface methods.  

---

### Input Format

- If `Filter`: next line contains threshold weight (integer).  

---

### Output Format
- For `DisplayAll`: Print all shipment weights.  
- For `Filter`: Print shipments heavier than the given threshold.  
- For `Average`: Print the average shipment weight.  

---

```
All shipment weights:
120
450
300
800
150
600
200
750
500
1000
```

---

### Sample Test Case 2
**Input**
```
Filter
500
```

    }
}
```

---

✨ Notice how this differs from earlier challenges:  
- Instead of **max / boundary / list**, we now have:  
  - **Total payout** (interface method)  
  - **Fraud check** (concrete method in abstract class)  
  - **Display all claims** (abstract method)  

Same **difficulty level**, but **different functionality**.  

Would you like me to now prepare a **Hospital vertical** with another unique functionality (e.g., patient billing summary, consultation count, etc.) so you have multiple varied challenges?



slug: banking-interest-calculator-with-exception-handling


Perfect 👍 — let’s design a **HackerRank‑style coding challenge** around **ArithmeticException** where the program gives the user **another chance** if the exception occurs (instead of just printing an error and stopping).  

I’ll keep it **simple and industry‑relevant** in the **Banking vertical**.

---

# 🏦 HackerRank Challenge: Banking EMI Calculator with Exception Handling

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a simple **Banking EMI Calculator**.  
The system should allow a user to calculate the **monthly EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)** for a loan.  

- Formula:  
  \[
  EMI = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate}}{\text{Months}}
  \]  
  where Rate is a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%).  

- If the user enters **zero months**, an `ArithmeticException` will occur.  
- Your program must **handle the exception** and give the user **another chance** to enter a valid number of months.  

---

### Input Format
- First line: Principal amount (integer)  
- Second line: Interest rate (integer, percentage)  
- Third line: Number of months (integer)  

If months = 0, the program should catch the exception and prompt the user again to enter months.  

---

### Output Format
- If months > 0: Print `"Monthly EMI: X"`  
- If months = 0: Print `"Invalid division: months cannot be zero"` and ask again.  

---

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ Principal ≤ 10^6  
- 1 ≤ Rate ≤ 100  
- Months ≥ 0  

---

### Sample Test Case 1  
**Input**
```
10000
10
12
```

**Output**
```
Monthly EMI: 83
```

---

### Sample Test Case 2  
**Input**
```
5000
8
0
24
```

**Output**
```
Invalid division: months cannot be zero
Monthly EMI: 16
```

---

### Sample Test Case 3  
**Input**
```
20000
12
0
0
36
```

**Output**
```
Invalid division: months cannot be zero
Invalid division: months cannot be zero
Monthly EMI: 66
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Skeleton Code (Java)

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BankingEMI {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int principal = sc.nextInt();
        int rate = sc.nextInt();
        int months = 0;
        boolean valid = false;

        while(!valid) {
            try {
                months = sc.nextInt();
                int emi = (principal * rate) / (months * 100); // may throw ArithmeticException
                System.out.println("Monthly EMI: " + emi);
                valid = true; // exit loop if successful
            } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
                System.out.println("Invalid division: months cannot be zero");
                // loop continues, giving another chance
            }
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
```

---

✨ This challenge teaches trainees:  
- How `ArithmeticException` occurs (division by zero).  
- How to **catch and handle** it.  
- How to **retry until valid input is given** (loop + exception handling).  

Would you like me to also prepare a **Retail vertical version** (e.g., average sales per day with retry on zero days) so you can give them multiple industry‑specific practice problems?





slug: banking-utility-loader-with-exception-handling


Got it 👍 — since you haven’t covered **SQL** or **files** yet, let’s keep the checked exception challenge **very simple** and still industry‑relevant. A great candidate is **ClassNotFoundException**, which is a checked exception that occurs when trying to load a class dynamically. It doesn’t require database or file knowledge, but it introduces trainees to the idea of checked exceptions.

---

# 🏦 HackerRank Challenge: Banking Utility Loader with Exception Handling

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with simulating a **Banking Utility Loader**.  
The program should attempt to load a class dynamically using its name.  

- If the class exists (e.g., `"java.util.Scanner"`), print `"Class loaded successfully"`.  
- If the class does not exist, handle the **checked exception (`ClassNotFoundException`)** and print `"Error: Class not found"`.  

Your program must demonstrate:  
- **Checked Exception Handling** using `try`–`catch`.  
- Handling `ClassNotFoundException` when an invalid class name is given.  

---

### Input Format
- A single line containing the class name (string).  

---

### Output Format
- If the class exists: `"Class loaded successfully"`  
- Otherwise: `"Error: Class not found"`  

---

### Constraints
- Class name length ≤ 50 characters.  

---

### Sample Test Case 1  
**Input**
```
java.util.Scanner
```

**Output**
```
Class loaded successfully
```

---

### Sample Test Case 2  
**Input**
```
banking.Utility
```

**Output**
```
Error: Class not found
```

---

### Sample Test Case 3  
**Input**
```
java.lang.String
```

**Output**
```
Class loaded successfully
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Skeleton Code (Java)

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BankingUtilityLoader {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String className = sc.nextLine();

        try {
            Class.forName(className); // may throw ClassNotFoundException
            System.out.println("Class loaded successfully");
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Class not found");
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
```

---

✨ This challenge is **simple, beginner‑friendly, and industry‑relevant**. It teaches trainees:
- What a **checked exception** is (`ClassNotFoundException`).  
- How to declare and handle it with `try`–`catch`.  
- How checked exceptions differ from runtime exceptions (they must be handled or declared).  

Would you like me to also prepare a **Retail vertical version** (e.g., simulating a “Product Utility Loader”) so you can give them variety across industries?

slug: menudriven-generic-statistics-analyzer
Perfect 👍 — let’s now **upgrade the Generic Statistics Analyzer challenge** into a **menu‑driven program**. This way, your trainees can interactively choose operations (instead of just one command at the end). It still uses **Generics, Interfaces, Arrays of Objects, and Methods**, but now with a **menu loop** that makes it more practical.

---

# 📊 HackerRank Challenge: Menu‑Driven Generic Statistics Analyzer

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a **Generic Statistics Analyzer** that works with different data types (Integer, Double, Long, String).  
The program should allow storing values in an array and then perform **analysis operations** interactively through a menu.  

Your program must demonstrate:  
- **Generics** → class and interface should work with multiple data types.  
- **Interface** → define methods for analysis operations.  
- **Array of Objects** → store values in a generic array.  
- **Menu‑Driven Approach** → repeatedly show options until the user chooses to exit.  

---

### Required Operations
1. Save a value  
2. Display all values  
3. Find maximum value  
4. Find minimum value  
5. Count elements  
6. Search for a value  
7. Exit  

---

### Input Format
- First line: Data type (`Integer`, `Double`, `Long`, `String`).  
- Second line: Size of storage.  
- Then menu options (integers 1–7) followed by required inputs.  

---

### Output Format
- For each operation, print the result as specified.  
- Continue showing the menu until the user chooses `7` (Exit).  

---

### Sample Test Case (Integer Example)  
**Input**
```
Integer
5
1
10
1
20
1
5
2

10 Saved at index: 0
20 Saved at index: 1
5 Saved at index: 2
[10, 20, 5, null, null]
Maximum value: 20
Minimum value: 5

slug: doctor-record-sorting-with-comparators
Perfect 👍 — let’s reframe the **Comparator sorting challenge** into a **health vertical with doctors**. This keeps the same concepts (custom comparators, sorting with `Collections.sort`) but applies them to **doctor records**.

---

# 🏥 HackerRank Challenge: Doctor Record Sorting with Comparators

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a **Doctor Record Management System** for a hospital.  
Each doctor has:  
- `name` (String)  
- `expertise` (String, e.g., Cardio, Ortho, Gyno, Gastro)  
- `experience` (Integer, in years)  
- `consultingTime` (Integer, in minutes per patient)  
- `qualification` (String, e.g., MBBS, MD, MS)  

You must implement comparators to sort doctors by:  
1. **Expertise Descending** (lexicographically reverse order of expertise)  
2. **Consulting Time Ascending** (shortest consulting time first)  
3. **Experience Descending** (most experienced first)  

---

### Input Format
- First line: Number of doctors `n`.  
- Next `n` lines: Each line contains `name expertise experience consultingTime qualification`.  
- Final line: Sorting choice (`expertise`, `consulting`, or `experience`).  

---

### Output Format
- Print the sorted list of doctors, one per line, in the format:  
  ```
  name - expertise - experience years - consultingTime mins - qualification
  ```

---

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 50  
- Expertise: one of {Cardio, Ortho, Gyno, Gastro}  
- Experience: 1 ≤ years ≤ 50  
- Consulting Time: 5 ≤ minutes ≤ 60  
- Qualification length ≤ 20 characters

✨ This challenge is **health‑related**, uses **Comparator sorting**, and gives trainees practice with:  
- Multiple attributes (`name`, `expertise`, `experience`, `consultingTime`, `qualification`).  
- Writing **three comparator classes**.  
- Applying `Collections.sort()` with different comparators.  

Would you like me to also extend this into a **menu‑driven version** where the user can repeatedly choose sorting criteria until exit?






slug: patient-management-with-hashmap

# 🏥 HackerRank Challenge: Patient Management with HashMap

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a **Patient Management System** using Java’s `HashMap`.  
Each patient has:  
- `id` (Integer, unique key)  
- `name` (String, value)  

You must implement CRUD operations:  
1. **Create** → Add a new patient (id → name).  
2. **Read** → Display all patients.  
3. **Update** → Update the name of a patient by id.  
4. **Delete** → Remove a patient by id.  

---

### Input Format
- First line: Number of operations `n`.  
- Next `n` lines: Each line contains an operation in one of the following formats:  
  - `create id name`  
  - `read`  
  - `update id newName`  
  - `delete id`  

---

### Output Format
- For `create`: Print `"Patient added: id-name"`  
- For `read`: Print all patients in the format `[id=name, id=name, ...]`  
- For `update`: Print `"Patient updated: id-newName"`  
- For `delete`: Print `"Patient deleted: id"`  
- If an operation refers to a non‑existent id, print `"Invalid operation"`

✨ This hospital‑based challenge teaches trainees:  
- How to use `HashMap` for CRUD.  
- How to handle invalid operations gracefully.  
- How to adapt the same logic across different verticals.  

Would you like me to also prepare a **Retail vertical version** (e.g., managing product inventory with HashMap) so your trainees can practice CRUD in yet another domain?



Slug: find-second-largest-values-position-via-binary-search



Perfect 👍 — thanks for clarifying. Since the input list is already **sorted**, we don’t need to sort again. The challenge is now simply:  

- Identify the **second largest value** in the sorted list.  
- Use **binary search** to locate it.  
- Return its **index in the original sorted list**.  

---

        while(left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if(list.get(mid) == target) {
                return mid; // found

✨ This challenge now directly matches your requirement:  
- Input is **already sorted**.  
- Find **second largest**.  
- Use **binary search** to locate its index.  

Would you like me to also prepare a **variation** where trainees must find the **second smallest value’s position** using binary search, so they practice both ends of the sorted list?

Slug: vehicle-queue-rotation-system

Perfect 👍 — let’s design a **HackerRank‑style challenge** where trainees practice **rotating a single‑dimensional array clockwise and anti‑clockwise**. To make it engaging, we’ll wrap it in an **industry vertical use case**.

---

# 🚗 HackerRank Challenge: Vehicle Queue Rotation System

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with simulating a **vehicle queue rotation system** at a toll plaza. Vehicles are represented by their **registration numbers** stored in a single‑dimensional array.  

- A **clockwise rotation** simulates moving the last vehicle to the front of the queue.  
- An **anti‑clockwise rotation** simulates moving the first vehicle to the end of the queue.  

Your program must:  
1. Read the list of vehicles.  
2. Perform the rotation based on user choice (`clockwise` or `anticlockwise`).  
3. Print the updated queue.  

---

### Input Format
- First line: Integer `n` (number of vehicles).  
- Second line: `n` space‑separated vehicle registration numbers (strings).  
- Third line: Rotation choice (`clockwise` or `anticlockwise`).  
- Fourth line: Integer `k` (number of rotations).  

---

### Output Format
- Print the updated queue after performing the rotations.  

---

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100  
- Vehicle registration numbers are alphanumeric strings (length ≤ 15).  
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000

✨ This challenge teaches trainees:  
- Array manipulation (rotation logic).  
- Handling both **clockwise** and **anti‑clockwise** rotations.  
- Wrapping the algorithm in a **real‑world industry vertical** (vehicle queue at toll plaza).  

Would you like me to also prepare a **healthcare vertical version** (e.g., rotating patient appointment slots) so trainees can see the same concept applied in another domain?






Slug: first-nonrepeating-character-in-a-stream
Contest slug: https://www.hackerrank.com/java-dsa-queue

Perfect 👍 — let’s wrap the **First Non‑Repeating Character in a Stream** problem into a **HackerRank‑style challenge** so your trainees can practice it directly.

---

# 🔤 HackerRank Challenge: First Non‑Repeating Character in a Stream

### Problem Statement  
You are given a stream of characters (string).  
At each step, you must find the **first non‑repeating character** among all characters seen so far.  
If no such character exists, output `#`.  

Use a **stack/queue + hashmap approach** to solve this efficiently.

---

### Input Format  
- A single line containing the string `stream`.  

---

### Output Format  
- Print the sequence of first non‑repeating characters after each step, separated by spaces.  

---

### Constraints  
- 1 ≤ length(stream) ≤ 1000  
- Stream contains only lowercase English letters (`a`–`z`).  

---

### Sample Test Case 1  
**Input**
```
aabc
```

**Output**
```
a a b #
```

**Explanation**  
- After `a`: first non‑repeating = `a`  
- After `aa`: still `a`  
- After `aab`: now `b`  
- After `aabc`: all repeated → `#`  

---

### Sample Test Case 2  
**Input**
```
xyzxy
```

**Output**
```
x x x y z
```

**Explanation**  
- After `x`: first non‑repeating = `x`  
- After `xy`: still `x`  
- After `xyz`: still `x`  
- After `xyzx`: now `y`  
- After `xyzxy`: now `z`  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Skeleton Code (Java)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FirstNonRepeatingChar {
    public static List<Character> firstNonRepeatingChar(String stream) {
        Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<Character> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        List<Character> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for (char ch : stream.toCharArray()) {
            // update frequency
            charCount.put(ch, charCount.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
            queue.add(ch);

            // remove repeated chars from front of queue
            while (!queue.isEmpty() && charCount.get(queue.peek()) > 1) {
                queue.poll();
            }

            // append current first non-repeating or '#' if none
            if (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                result.add(queue.peek());
            } else {
                result.add('#');
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String stream = sc.nextLine();
        List<Character> output = firstNonRepeatingChar(stream);
        for (char c : output) {
            System.out.print(c + " ");
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

---

✨ This challenge is **simple but powerful**:  
- It teaches **queue + hashmap** usage.  
- It reinforces **stream processing**.  
- It gives trainees a **classic interview‑style problem** in HackerRank format.  

Would you like me to also prepare a **slightly harder variant** (e.g., *First Non‑Repeating Character in a sliding window of size k*) so they can extend their stack/queue skills further?

# 📥 HackerRank Challenge: Implement Queue using Array (Menu Driven)

### Problem Statement  
You are tasked with implementing a **Queue data structure** using an **array**.  
The queue should support the following operations via a **menu‑driven program**:  
1. **enqueue X** → Insert element `X` into the queue.  
2. **dequeue** → Remove the front element from the queue. If the queue is empty, print `"Queue Underflow"`.  
3. **peek** → Print the front element of the queue. If the queue is empty, print `"Queue is empty"`.  
4. **display** → Print all elements of the queue from front to rear. If the queue is empty, print `"Queue is empty"`.  
5. **exit** → Terminate the program.  

---

### Input Format  
- First line: Integer `n` (maximum size of the queue).  
- Next lines: Menu‑driven commands (`enqueue X`, `dequeue`, `peek`, `display`, `exit`).  

---

### Output Format  
- For `enqueue`: Print `"Enqueued X"`  
- For `dequeue`: Print `"Dequeued X"` or `"Queue Underflow"`  
- For `peek`: Print the front element or `"Queue is empty"`  
- For `display`: Print all elements from front to rear separated by space, or `"Queue is empty"`

Slug: maximum-element-using-ternary-partitioning
Contest Slug: https://www.hackerrank.com/java-ece-search

Perfect clarification 👍 — you don’t want me to keep generating only *search‑based* HackerRank challenges. You want me to take the **ternary partitioning logic** (splitting into three parts) and apply it to **other problems like sum, max, min**. That way trainees see how ternary partitioning can be used beyond searching.

Here are **three HackerRank‑style challenges** inspired by your ternary partitioning code:

---

# ➗ Challenge 1: Sum of Array using Ternary Partitioning

### Problem Statement  
You are given an array of integers.  
Implement a recursive algorithm that **splits the array into three parts** (using two midpoints) and computes the **sum of all elements**.

---

### Input Format  
- First line: Integer `n` (number of elements).  
- Second line: `n` space‑separated integers.  

### Output Format  
- Print the sum of all elements.  

---

### Sample Input  
```
6
5 10 15 20 25 30

✨ These challenges show trainees how **ternary partitioning** can be applied to **aggregation problems** (sum, max, min), not just searching. They reinforce recursion and divide‑and‑conquer thinking in a fresh way.

Would you like me to also prepare a **“ternary partitioning for finding the median”** challenge? That would be a nice next step beyond sum/max/min.





Slug: find-pivot-index-6-3

Perfect 👍 — let’s turn your **`find_pivot_index`** function into a **complete HackerRank‑style coding challenge**.  

---

# ⚖️ HackerRank Challenge: Find Pivot Index

### Problem Statement  
You are given an array of integers.  
A **pivot index** is defined as the index where the **sum of all elements to the left** equals the **sum of all elements to the right**.  

Your task is to find the **first pivot index** if it exists.  
- If multiple pivot indices exist, return the **leftmost one**.  
- If no pivot index exists, return `-1`.  

---

### Input Format  
- First line: Integer `n` (number of elements).  
- Second line: `n` space‑separated integers.  

---

### Output Format  
- Print the pivot index if it exists, otherwise print `-1`.  

---

### Constraints  
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  
- −10^5 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^5  

---

### Sample Test Case 1  
**Input**
```
6
1 7 3 6 5 6
```

**Output**
```
3
```

**Explanation**  
At index `3` (value `6`):  
- Left sum = `1+7+3 = 11`  
- Right sum = `5+6 = 11`  
So pivot index = `3`.

---

### Sample Test Case 2  
**Input**
```
3
2 1 -1
```

**Output**
```
0
```

**Explanation**  
At index `0` (value `2`):  
- Left sum = `0`  
- Right sum = `1 + (-1) = 0`  
So pivot index = `0`.

---

### Sample Test Case 3  
**Input**
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Output**
```
-1
```

**Explanation**  
No index satisfies the condition.  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Skeleton Code (Java)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class PivotIndexChallenge {

    public static int findPivotIndex(int[] nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;

        int leftSum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            if(leftSum == totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            leftSum += nums[i];
        }
        return -1;
    }

            nums[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        System.out.println(findPivotIndex(nums));
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

✨ This challenge is **simple but conceptually rich**:  
- It teaches prefix sums and balancing logic.  
- It reinforces iteration and condition checking.  
- It’s a classic interview‑style problem, now in HackerRank format.  

Would you like me to also prepare a **variant challenge** (e.g., *find all pivot indices* instead of just the first one) so trainees can extend their solution?






Slug: validate-binary-search-tree-7-2
Contest Slug: https://www.hackerrank.com/java-dsa-tree

Perfect 👍 — let’s design a **complete HackerRank‑style challenge** for validating whether a given binary tree is a **valid Binary Search Tree (BST)**.

---

# 🌳 HackerRank Challenge: Validate Binary Search Tree

### Problem Statement  
You are given the root of a binary tree.  
Your task is to determine whether the tree is a **valid Binary Search Tree (BST)**.  

A valid BST is defined as:  
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node’s key.  
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node’s key.  
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be valid BSTs.  

---

### Input Format  
- First line: Integer `n` (number of nodes).  
- Next `n` lines: Each line contains three values:  
  ```
  node_value left_child_index right_child_index
  ```  
  where `left_child_index` and `right_child_index` are indices of the child nodes (or `-1` if no child).  
- The root of the tree is always at index `0`.  

---

### Output Format  
- Print `"Valid BST"` if the tree is a valid BST.  
- Print `"Invalid BST"` otherwise.  

---

### Constraints  
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  
- −10^5 ≤ node_value ≤ 10^5  

---

### Sample Test Case 1  
**Input**
```
3

```

**Output**
```
Valid BST
```

**Explanation**  
Tree structure:  
```
    2
   / \
  1   3
```
This satisfies BST properties.

---

### Sample Test Case 2  
**Input**
```
3
5 1 2
1 -1 -1
4 -1 -1
```

**Output**
```
Invalid BST
```

**Explanation**  
Tree structure:  
```
    5
   / \
  1   4
```
Right child `4` is less than root `5`, violating BST property.

---

### Sample Test Case 3  
**Input**

5
10 1 2
5 -1 -1
15 3 4
6 -1 -1

      /  \
     5    15
         /  \
        6    20

Slug: construct-tree-from-inorder-traversal
Perfect 👍 — let’s design a **complete HackerRank‑style challenge** where trainees are asked to reconstruct a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** from its **inorder traversal output** and then identify its structure.

---

# 🌳 HackerRank Challenge: Construct Tree from Inorder Traversal

### Problem Statement  
You are given the **inorder traversal** of a Binary Search Tree (BST).  
Your task is to reconstruct the BST and print its structure using **preorder traversal** (root → left → right).  

- Recall:  
  - Inorder traversal of a BST gives nodes in **sorted order**.  
  - To reconstruct the BST uniquely, assume the tree is **height‑balanced** (like an AVL tree).  
  - The middle element of the inorder list becomes the root, the left half forms the left subtree, and the right half forms the right subtree recursively.  

---

### Input Format  
- First line: Integer `n` (number of nodes).  
- Second line: `n` space‑separated integers representing the inorder traversal of the BST.  

---

### Output Format  
- Print the **preorder traversal** of the reconstructed BST (space‑separated integers).  

---

### Constraints  
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  
- −10^5 ≤ node_value ≤ 10^5  

---

### Sample Test Case 1  
**Input**
```
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

**Output**
```
4 2 1 3 6 5 7
```

**Explanation**  
- Inorder: `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`  
- Middle = `4` → root.  
- Left subtree = `[1,2,3]` → root `2`, children `1` and `3`.  
- Right subtree = `[5,6,7]` → root `6`, children `5` and `7`.  
- Preorder traversal = `4 2 1 3 6 5 7`.

---

### Sample Test Case 2  
**Input**
```
5
10 20 30 40 50
```

**Output**
```
30 20 10 40 50
```

**Explanation**  
- Inorder: `[10,20,30,40,50]`  
- Middle = `30` → root.  
- Left subtree = `[10,20]` → root `20`, left child `10`.  
- Right subtree = `[40,50]` → root `40`, right child `50`.  
- Preorder traversal = `30 20 10 40 50`.

---

### Sample Test Case 3  
**Input**
```
6
2 4 6 8 10 12
```

**Output**
```
8 4 2 6 10 12
```

**Explanation**  
- Inorder: `[2,4,6,8,10,12]`  
- Middle = `8` → root.  
- Left subtree = `[2,4,6]` → root `4`, children `2` and `6`.  
- Right subtree = `[10,12]` → root `10`, right child `12`.  
- Preorder traversal = `8 4 2 6 10 12`.

Perfect choice, S 🙌. Let’s draft **HackerRank-style challenges** for both problems. I’ll give you full problem statements, input/output formats, constraints, and sample cases — exactly in the style HackerRank uses.

---

# 📌 Challenge 1: K-th Order Statistic (Fenwick Tree)

### Problem Statement
You are given a multiset of integers initially empty. You need to process queries of the following types:

1. `1 x` → Insert integer `x` into the multiset.  
2. `2 x` → Delete one occurrence of integer `x` from the multiset (it is guaranteed that `x` exists).  
3. `3 k` → Print the k-th smallest integer in the multiset (1-indexed).

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer `q` — the number of queries.  
- Each of the next `q` lines contains a query in one of the formats above.

### Output Format
- For each query of type `3`, output the k-th smallest integer on a new line.

### Constraints
- \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)  
- \(1 \leq x \leq 10^6\)  
- \(1 \leq k \leq\) size of the multiset at the time of query  

### Sample Input
```
7
1 5
1 2
1 8
3 2
2 5
1 3
3 2
```

### Sample Output
```
5
3
```

### Explanation
- After inserting 5, 2, 8 → multiset = {2, 5, 8}.  
- Query `3 2` → 2nd smallest = 5.  
- Delete 5 → multiset = {2, 8}.  
- Insert 3 → multiset = {2, 3, 8}.  
- Query `3 2` → 2nd smallest = 3.

---

# 📌 Challenge 2: Range GCD Queries (Segment Tree)

### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers. You need to process two types of queries:

1. `1 i v` → Update the element at index `i` to value `v`.  
2. `2 l r` → Print the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the range `[l, r]`.

### Input Format
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `q` — the size of the array and the number of queries.  
- The second line contains `n` integers — the initial array.  
- Each of the next `q` lines contains a query in one of the formats above.

### Output Format
- For each query of type `2`, output the GCD of the specified range on a new line.

### Constraints
- \(1 \leq n, q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)  
- \(1 \leq a[i], v \leq 10^9\)  
- \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq n\)  
- \(1 \leq i \leq n\)

### Sample Input
```
5 4
2 4 6 8 10
2 1 3
1 2 12
2 1 3
2 3 5
```

### Sample Output
```
2
2
2
```

### Explanation
- Initial array = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].  
- Query `2 1 3` → gcd(2,4,6) = 2.  
- Update index 2 → array = [2, 12, 6, 8, 10].  
- Query `2 1 3` → gcd(2,12,6) = 2.  
- Query `2 3 5` → gcd(6,8,10) = 2.

✅ These are **ready-to-use HackerRank-style challenges**. You can drop them straight into your contest setup.  

Would you like me to also **add vertical-specific flavors** (like healthcare, logistics, retail) to these problems so they align with your trainee themes? That way, the same data structure logic is wrapped in a real-world scenario.

---

✅ Now you have **two complete HackerRank challenges** with **three test cases each**, strictly aligned with what you’ve taught (adjacency, BFS/DFS, degree).  

Would you like me to also **draft the stepwise solution outlines** (DFS recursion trace for cycle detection, BFS/DFS exploration for components) so your trainees can see the *flow of values* exactly the way you prefer to teach?

Got it, S 👍. You want **two more problems at the same level of complexity as the overriding-based retail store example** (not the simpler inheritance one). I’ll design them so they push your trainees to think about **method overriding, polymorphism, and distinct vertical contexts**, while staying within the concepts you’ve already covered.

# 🚀 Challenge 1: **Banking System – Overriding Interest Calculation**

### Problem Statement  
You are designing a banking system.  
- A base class `BankAccount` has a method `calculateInterest(double amount)` that returns **3% interest**.  
- A derived class `SavingsAccount` overrides the method to return **5% interest**.  
- A derived class `FixedDepositAccount` overrides the method to return **7% interest**.  

Write a program that:  
1. Reads deposit amount and account type.  
2. Prints the interest earned.  

### Input Format  
- First line: Deposit amount (double)  
- Second line: Account type (`Savings` or `FixedDeposit`)  

### Output Format  
- Print interest in the format:  
  ```
  Interest: <value>
  ```

### Constraints  
- Amount is between 1000 and 1000000.  
- Account type is either `Savings` or `FixedDeposit`.  

### Sample Input  
```
50000
FixedDeposit
```

### Sample Output  
```
Interest: 3500.0
```

---

### Skeleton Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class BankAccount {
    public double calculateInterest(double amount){
        return amount * 0.03;
    }
}

class SavingsAccount extends BankAccount {
    @Override
    public double calculateInterest(double amount){
        return amount * 0.05;
    }
}

class FixedDepositAccount extends BankAccount {
    @Override
    public double calculateInterest(double amount){
        return amount * 0.07;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        double amount = sc.nextDouble();
        String type = sc.next();

        BankAccount account;
        if(type.equals("Savings")){
            account = new SavingsAccount();
        } else {
            account = new FixedDepositAccount();
        }

        double interest = account.calculateInterest(amount);
        System.out.println("Interest: " + interest);
    }
}
```

# 🚀 Challenge 2: **Library System – Overriding Fine Calculation**

### Problem Statement  
You are designing a library system.  
- A base class `LibraryItem` has a method `calculateFine(int daysLate)` that returns **₹2 per day**.  
- A derived class `Book` overrides the method to return **₹5 per day**.  
- A derived class `Magazine` overrides the method to return **₹3 per day**.  

Write a program that:  
1. Reads number of days late and item type.  
2. Prints the fine amount.  

### Input Format  
- First line: Number of days late (integer)  
- Second line: Item type (`Book` or `Magazine`)  

### Output Format  
- Print fine in the format:  
  ```
  Fine: <value>
  ```

### Constraints  
- Days late is between 1 and 60.  
- Item type is either `Book` or `Magazine`.  

### Sample Input  
```
10
Book
```

### Sample Output  
```
Fine: 50
```

---

### Skeleton Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class LibraryItem {
    public int calculateFine(int daysLate){
        return daysLate * 2;
    }
}

class Book extends LibraryItem {
    @Override
    public int calculateFine(int daysLate){
        return daysLate * 5;
    }
}

class Magazine extends LibraryItem {
    @Override
    public int calculateFine(int daysLate){
        return daysLate * 3;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int daysLate = sc.nextInt();
        String type = sc.next();

        LibraryItem item;
        if(type.equals("Book")){
            item = new Book();
        } else {
            item = new Magazine();
        }

        int fine = item.calculateFine(daysLate);
        System.out.println("Fine: " + fine);
    }
}
```

---

✅ Both problems are **distinct, vertical-specific, and override-focused** like your Monitor/Warehouse and Retail Store examples.  
- Challenge 1: Banking → overriding interest calculation.  
- Challenge 2: Library → overriding fine calculation.  

Would you like me to also **add hidden test cases** (multiple variations with edge values) so you can directly plug them into HackerRank’s test case section?

Perfect, S 👌. Let’s enrich both problems with **at least 3 test cases each** (covering normal, edge, and variation scenarios). This way you can directly plug them into HackerRank’s test case section.

---

# 🚀 Challenge 1: Banking System – Overriding Interest Calculation

### Sample Test Cases

**Test Case 1 (Normal case)**  
Input:  
```
50000
FixedDeposit
```  
Output:  
```
Interest: 3500.0
```

**Test Case 2 (Savings account)**  
Input:  
```
20000
Savings
```  
Output:  
```
Interest: 1000.0
```

**Test Case 3 (Edge case – minimum deposit)**  
Input:  
```
1000
Savings
```  
Output:  
```
Interest: 50.0
```

---

# 🚀 Challenge 2: Library System – Overriding Fine Calculation

### Sample Test Cases

**Test Case 1 (Book late return)**  
Input:  
```
10
Book
```  
Output:  
```
Fine: 50
```

**Test Case 2 (Magazine late return)**  
Input:  
```
7
Magazine
```  
Output:  
```
Fine: 21
```

**Test Case 3 (Edge case – maximum days late)**  
Input:  
```
60
Book
```  
Output:  
```
Fine: 300
```

---

✅ Now each problem has **3 clear test cases** (normal, variation, and edge).  
Would you like me to also **bundle these into HackerRank-style hidden test cases** (with multiple inputs/outputs in one file) so your trainees can’t just hardcode answers?

Reconstruct Itinerary
You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.
All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]

Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.






Word Ladder
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk 
such that:
Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. 
Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

Example 1:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

Example 2:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.







Swim in Rising Water
You are given an n x n integer matrix grid where each value grid[i][j] represents the elevation at that point (i, j).
It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time t, the water level is t, meaning any cell with elevation less than equal to t is submerged or reachable.
You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.
Return the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square (n - 1, n - 1) if you start at the top left square (0, 0).

Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.






Alien Dictionary problem
You’re given a list of words sorted according to an alien language dictionary. The task is to determine the order of characters in that alien language.
Given a sorted dictionary of an alien language, find the order of the characters. The dictionary is given in the form of a list of words where the order of characters is lexicographically increasing

Problem Statement
You’re given a list of words sorted according to an **alien language dictionary**. The task is to determine the order of characters in that alien language.

---

 Key Idea
- The words are sorted lexicographically according to alien rules.
- By comparing **adjacent words**, we can deduce ordering constraints between characters.
- These constraints form a **directed graph** (edges: `u → v` means `u` comes before `v`).
- The solution is to perform a **topological sort** on this graph.

Stepwise Approach

1. Input Example
   words = ["baa", "abcd", "abca", "cab", "cad"]

   Alphabet size = 4 (say `a, b, c, d`).

2.  Build Graph
   - Compare `baa` vs `abcd` → first differing char: `b` vs `a` → edge `b → a`.
   - Compare `abcd` vs `abca` → differing char: `d` vs `a` → edge `d → a`.
   - Compare `abca` vs `cab` → differing char: `a` vs `c` → edge `a → c`.
   - Compare `cab` vs `cad` → differing char: `b` vs `d` → edge `b → d`.

   Graph edges:
   b → a
   d → a
   a → c
   b → d


3. Graph Representation (Adjacency List)
   b: [a, d]
   d: [a]
   a: [c]
   c: []

4. Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm or DFS)
   - In-degree array:
     a: 2 (from b, d)
     b: 0
     c: 1 (from a)
     d: 1 (from b)
   - Start with nodes of in-degree 0 → `[b]`.
   - Process `b`: remove edges → decrease in-degree of `a` (1), `d` (0).
   - Now queue = `[d]`.
   - Process `d`: decrease in-degree of `a` (0).
   - Now queue = `[a]`.
   - Process `a`: decrease in-degree of `c` (0).
   - Now queue = `[c]`.
   - Process `c`.
   Order = `b → d → a → c`.

Final Answer
The alien dictionary order is:
b d a c


Would you like me to also **trace this with recursion (DFS-based topological sort)** so you can see how the call stack unfolds step by step? That way you’ll have both iterative (Kahn’s) and recursive (DFS) perspectives.

✨ Now both verticals have **constraints + 3 test cases each**. This makes them HackerRank-ready and ensures trainees can validate CRUD logic step by step.  

Would you like me to also **draft skeleton Java code** for these (bean + ArrayList + switch-case menu), so your trainees can directly implement the operations against these test cases?









AiDS:
Slug: surrounded-regions-3-1
Slug: clone-graph-4
Contest: https://www.hackerrank.com/java-dsa-graph-4

Here’s how you can structure this problem in a **HackerRank-style challenge format** — with **problem statement, input/output format, constraints, and multiple test cases**.  

---

# Clone Graph

## Problem Statement  
You are given a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph. Your task is to return a **deep copy (clone)** of the graph.  

Each node in the graph contains:  
- `int val` (unique identifier for the node)  
- `List<Node> neighbors` (list of neighboring nodes)  

```java
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

The graph is represented using an **adjacency list**.  
- Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node.  
- Node values are **1-indexed** (the first node has `val = 1`, the second has `val = 2`, etc.).  
- The given node will always be the first node (`val = 1`).  

You must return the cloned graph starting from node `1`.  

---

## Input Format  
- A single adjacency list `adjList`, where `adjList[i]` contains the neighbors of node `(i+1)`.  

## Output Format  
- Return the adjacency list of the cloned graph in the same format.  

---

## Constraints  
- Number of nodes `n` is in the range `[0, 100]`.  
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`  
- Node values are unique.  
- No repeated edges and no self-loops.  
- The graph is connected (all nodes can be visited starting from node `1`).  

---

## Sample Test Cases  

### Test Case 1  
**Input:**  
```
[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
```  

**Output:**  
```
[[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
```  

**Explanation:**  
There are 4 nodes in the graph.  
- Node 1 → neighbors [2,4]  
- Node 2 → neighbors [1,3]  
- Node 3 → neighbors [2,4]  
- Node 4 → neighbors [1,3]  

---

### Test Case 2  
**Input:**  
```
[[]]
```  

**Output:**  
```
[[]]
```  

**Explanation:**  
The graph has only one node (val = 1) and no neighbors.  

---

### Test Case 3  
**Input:**  
```
[]
```  

**Output:**  
```
[]
```  

**Explanation:**  
The graph is empty, so the output is also empty.  

---

### Test Case 4  
**Input:**  
```
[[2],[1,3],[2]]
```  

**Output:**  
```
[[2],[1,3],[2]]
```  

**Explanation:**  
This graph has 3 nodes:  
- Node 1 → neighbors [2]  
- Node 2 → neighbors [1,3]  
- Node 3 → neighbors [2]  

---

import java.util.*;

        this.val = val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public Node(int val, List<Node> neighbors) {
        this.val = val;
        this.neighbors = neighbors;
    }
}

public class CloneGraph {

    // Map to store visited nodes and their clones
    private Map<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();

    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;

        // If already cloned, return the clone
        if (visited.containsKey(node)) {
            return visited.get(node);
        }

        // Create a new node with the same value
        Node cloneNode = new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<>());
        visited.put(node, cloneNode);

        // Recursively clone neighbors
        for (Node neighbor : node.neighbors) {

# 🌊 Challenge 1: Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

### Problem Statement  
You are given an `m × n` matrix of non‑negative integers representing the height of each cell.  
Water can flow from a cell to another if the next cell’s height is **less than or equal** to the current cell’s height and they are adjacent (up, down, left, or right).  

- The **Pacific Ocean** touches the left and top edges of the matrix.  
- The **Atlantic Ocean** touches the right and bottom edges of the matrix.  

Your task is to find all cells from which water can flow to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  

---

### Input Format  
- First line: Two integers `m` and `n` (matrix dimensions).  
- Next `m` lines: Each line contains `n` integers representing the height matrix.  

---

### Output Format  
- Print all coordinates `(row, col)` where water can flow to both oceans.  
- Coordinates should be printed one per line.  

---

### Constraints  
- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 200  
- 0 ≤ height[i][j] ≤ 10^5

✨ Both challenges are now in **HackerRank format**:  
- Clear **problem statements**.  
- Defined **input/output formats**.  
- **Constraints**.  
- Multiple **sample test cases**.  
- **Java skeleton code** ready for students.  

Would you like me to also prepare **extra sample test cases** (edge cases like single cell grids, all rotten, all fresh) so your students can’t hardcode solutions?

---

# 👫 HackerRank Challenge: Couples Holding Hands

### Problem Statement  
There are `n` couples sitting in `2n` seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.  

- The people and seats are represented by an integer array `row` where `row[i]` is the ID of the person sitting in the `i`‑th seat.  
- Couples are numbered in order:  
  - Couple 0 → persons `(0, 1)`  
  - Couple 1 → persons `(2, 3)`  
  - …  
  - Couple `n-1` → persons `(2n-2, 2n-1)`  

Return the **minimum number of swaps** so that every couple is sitting side by side.  
A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

---

### Input Format  
- First line: integer `n` (number of couples).  
- Second line: `2n` space‑separated integers representing the seating arrangement `row`.  

---

### Output Format  
- Print a single integer: the minimum number of swaps required.  

---

### Constraints  
- `2n == row.length`  
- `2 <= n <= 30`  
- `0 <= row[i] < 2n`  
- All elements of `row` are unique  

---

### Sample Test Cases  

#### Test Case 1  
**Input**  
```
2
0 2 1 3
```

**Output**  
```
1
```

**Explanation**  
Swap `row[1]` and `row[2]` → `[0,1,2,3]`. Couples are together.

---

#### Test Case 2  
**Input**  
```
2
3 2 0 1
```

**Output**  
```
0
```

**Explanation**  
Couples `(0,1)` and `(2,3)` are already side by side.

---

#### Test Case 3  
**Input**  
```
3
5 4 2 3 0 1
```

**Output**  
```
0
```

**Explanation**  
Couples `(0,1)`, `(2,3)`, `(4,5)` are already seated together.

# 🐭🐱 HackerRank Challenge: Cat and Mouse Game

### Problem Statement  
A game on an undirected graph is played by two players: **Mouse** and **Cat**.  

- The graph is represented as an adjacency list: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b`.  
- The **Mouse** starts at node `1` and moves first.  
- The **Cat** starts at node `2` and moves second.  
- There is a **Hole** at node `0`.  

Rules:  
1. On each turn, a player must move along one edge from their current node.  
2. The Cat is **not allowed** to move into the Hole (node `0`).  
3. The game ends when:  
   - The Cat and Mouse occupy the same node → **Cat wins**.  
   - The Mouse reaches the Hole → **Mouse wins**.  
   - A position repeats (same Mouse position, Cat position, and turn) → **Draw**.  

Assuming both players play optimally, return:  
- `1` if the Mouse wins,  
- `2` if the Cat wins,  
- `0` if the game is a draw.  

---

### Input Format  
- First line: integer `n` (number of nodes in the graph).  
- Next `n` lines: adjacency list for each node, space‑separated integers.  

---

### Output Format  
- Print a single integer: `1`, `2`, or `0`.  

---

### Constraints  
- `3 <= n <= 50`  
- `1 <= graph[i].length < n`  
- `0 <= graph[i][j] < n`  
- `graph[i][j] != i`  
- All adjacency lists are unique  
- Both Mouse and Cat can always move  

---

### Sample Test Cases  

#### Test Case 1  
**Input**  
```

2 5
3
0 4 5
1 4 5
2 3
0 2 3
```

**Output**  
```

```

**Explanation**  
Optimal play leads to a repeated position → Draw.

---

#### Test Case 2  
**Input**  
```
4
1 3
0
3
0 2
```

**Output**  
```
1
```

**Explanation**  
Mouse can reach the Hole before Cat catches it → Mouse wins.

---

#### Test Case 3  
**Input**  
```
5
1 2
0 2
0 1 3 4
2 4
2 3

Contest: https://www.hackerrank.com/java-ece-collection-3

Perfect request, S 🙌. Let’s design a **HackerRank-style challenge** around representing a **directed weighted graph**. This will give your trainees practice with adjacency maps, lists, and handling weights — but in a fresh vertical context.

---

# 🚀 HackerRank Challenge: Directed Weighted Graph Representation

### Problem Statement
A logistics company wants to model its delivery network as a **directed weighted graph**.  
- Each **vertex** represents a warehouse.  
- Each **directed edge** represents a delivery route from one warehouse to another.  
- Each edge has a **weight** representing the delivery cost.  

Write a program to build this graph and print its adjacency list representation.

---

### Input Format
- First line: integer `n` (number of routes)  
- Next `n` lines: three values — `source destination weight`  

---

### Output Format
- Print the adjacency list of the graph.  
- Each line should show:  
  ```
  source -> [(destination1, weight1), (destination2, weight2), ...]
  ```

---

### Sample Input
```
5
A B 10
A C 15
B D 12
C D 10
D E 5
```

### Sample Output
```
A -> [(B,10), (C,15)]
B -> [(D,12)]
C -> [(D,10)]
D -> [(E,5)]
E -> []
```

---

### HackerRank-Style Template (Java)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private Map<String, List<String>> adjacency;

    public Solution() {
        adjacency = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void addEdge(String src, String dest, int weight) {
        adjacency.putIfAbsent(src, new ArrayList<>());
        adjacency.putIfAbsent(dest, new ArrayList<>());
        adjacency.get(src).add("(" + dest + "," + weight + ")");
    }

    public void printGraph() {
        for (String key : adjacency.keySet()) {
            System.out.println(key + " -> " + adjacency.get(key));
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        Solution graph = new Solution();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String src = sc.next();
            String dest = sc.next();
            int weight = sc.nextInt();
            graph.addEdge(src, dest, weight);
        }
        graph.printGraph();
    }
}
```

---

✨ This challenge is **different from your earlier undirected graph example** — here we enforce **direction** and **weights**, which makes it closer to real-world logistics, airline routes, or even network latency modeling.  

Would you like me to also **extend this challenge** with a follow-up task (like finding the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm) so trainees can progress from representation to algorithmic application?

1. Container With Most Water, You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 
Constraints:
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

# 🚚 HackerRank Challenge: Logistics Regex Validation

### Problem Statement  
In logistics and supply chain management, identifiers like **container numbers**, **tracking IDs**, and **timestamps** must follow strict formats.  
Your task is to validate and extract these using **regular expressions**.

You are given a string `S`. Determine which type of logistics identifier it represents:

- **Container Number**: Format `ABCD1234567`  
  - 4 uppercase letters followed by 7 digits.  
  - Regex: `^[A-Z]{4}\d{7}$`  
- **Tracking ID**: Format `TRK-987654321`  
  - Starts with `TRK-` followed by 9 digits.  
  - Regex: `^TRK-\d{9}$`  
- **Timestamp**: Format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`  
  - Regex: `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}$`  

If the string matches one of these formats, print the type:  
- `"CONTAINER"`  
- `"TRACKING"`  
- `"TIMESTAMP"`  

Otherwise, print `"INVALID"`.

---

### Input Format  
- A single line containing the string `S`.  

---

### Output Format  
- Print one of: `"CONTAINER"`, `"TRACKING"`, `"TIMESTAMP"`, or `"INVALID"`.

AiDS:
Slug: minimum-interval-to-include-each-query
Slug: gas-station-circuit-1
Contest: https://www.hackerrank.com/java-dsa-greedy-intervals


1. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query
You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] describes the ith interval starting at lefti and ending at righti (inclusive). The size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally righti - lefti + 1.
You are also given an integer array queries. The answer to the jth query is the size of the smallest interval i such that lefti <= queries[j] <= righti. If no such interval exists, the answer is -1.
Return an array containing the answers to the queries.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,3,1,4]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]
Output: [2,-1,4,6]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.
- Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.
- Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.


2. Gas Station, There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

Example 1:
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

Example 2:
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
 
Constraints:
n == gas.length == cost.length
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104
The input is generated such that the answer is unique.

Got it 👍 — you’d like the **Linked List Cycle Detection** challenge expressed in a way that uses **array representation** instead of a `ListNode` class. Let’s re‑frame the HackerRank challenge accordingly.

# 🔗 HackerRank Challenge: Linked List Cycle Detection (Array Representation)

### Problem Statement  
You are given a linked list represented as an **array of next indices**.  

- Each element in the array represents the index of the next node.  
- If a node points to `-1`, it means the end of the list (`null`).  
- A cycle exists if any node eventually points back to a previously visited node.  

Determine if the linked list contains a cycle.  

- Print `true` if a cycle exists.  
- Print `false` otherwise.  

---

### Input Format  
- First line: integer `n` (number of nodes).  
- Second line: `n` space‑separated integers, where the `i`‑th integer is the index of the next node for node `i` (`-1` if no next).  

---

### Output Format  
- Print `true` if the linked list contains a cycle.  
- Print `false` otherwise.  

---

### Constraints  
- \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)  
- Each next index is either `-1` or between `0` and `n-1`.  

Thanks for pointing that out 🙌 — let’s carefully re‑explain the **Linked List Cycle Detection (Array Representation)** challenge so the **input format, test cases, and explanation** line up perfectly.

---

## 🔗 Challenge Restated Clearly

We represent a linked list using an **array of next indices**:

- Each index `i` in the array corresponds to a node.  
- The value at `next[i]` tells you which node index this node points to.  
- If `next[i] = -1`, it means the node points to `null` (end of list).  
- A **cycle** exists if following these pointers eventually loops back to a previously visited node.

---

## ✅ Input Format
1. First line: integer `n` → number of nodes.  
2. Second line: `n` space‑separated integers → the `next` array, where `next[i]` is the index of the next node for node `i` (or `-1` if none).  

---

## ✅ Output Format
- Print `true` if the linked list contains a cycle.  
- Print `false` otherwise.  

---

## 🧪 Test Cases (Corrected)

### Test Case 1
**Input**
```
3
1 2 -1

**Explanation**

## ✅ Java Implementation (Array Representation)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LinkedListCycleArray {
    public static boolean hasCycle(int[] next) {
        int slow = 0, fast = 0;
        while (true) {
            // Move slow by 1 step
            slow = (slow == -1) ? -1 : next[slow];
            // Move fast by 2 steps
            if (fast == -1 || next[fast] == -1) fast = -1;
            else fast = next[next[fast]];

            if (slow == -1 || fast == -1) return false; // reached end
            if (slow == fast) return true; // cycle detected
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] next = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            next[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        System.out.println(hasCycle(next));
        sc.close();
    }
}
```

---

✨ Now the **input format, test cases, and explanations are consistent**:  
- Input is always `n` followed by the `next` array.  
- Output is always `true` or `false`.  
- Explanations match the pointer structure exactly.  

Would you like me to also add a **visual diagram** (like arrows showing node connections) for each test case so it’s even easier to see how the cycle forms?



AiDS:
Slug: minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone
Slug: merge-triplets-to-form-target-triplet
Contest: https://www.hackerrank.com/java-dsa-greedy

1. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone,There are n availabe seats and n students standing in a room. You are given an array seats of length n, where seats[i] is the position of the ith seat. You are also given the array students of length n, where students[j] is the position of the jth student.
You may perform the following move any number of times:
Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)
Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.
Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.

Example 1:
Input: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third student is moved from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.

Example 2:
Input: seats = [4,1,5,9], students = [1,3,2,6]
Output: 7
Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is not moved.
- The second student is moved from position 3 to position 4 using 1 move.
- The third student is moved from position 2 to position 5 using 3 moves.
- The fourth student is moved from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.
In total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.

Example 3:
Input: seats = [2,2,6,6], students = [1,3,2,6]
Output: 4
Explanation: Note that there are two seats at position 2 and two seats at position 6.
The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.
- The third student is not moved.
- The fourth student is not moved.
In total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.

Constraints:
n == seats.length == students.length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= seats[i], students[j] <= 100


2. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet, A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] describes the ith triplet. You are also given an integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the triplet you want to obtain.
To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets any number of times (possibly zero):
Choose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j) and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].
For example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].
Return true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the following operations:
- Choose the first and last triplets [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]]. Update the last triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,7), max(3,5)] = [2,7,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[2,7,5]]
The target triplet [2,7,5] is now an element of triplets.

Example 2:
Input: triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]], target = [3,2,5]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to have [3,2,5] as an element because there is no 2 in any of the triplets.

Example 3:
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]], target = [5,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the following operations:
- Choose the first and third triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]]. Update the third triplet to be [max(2,1), max(5,2), max(3,5)] = [2,5,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]].
- Choose the third and fourth triplets [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,2,3]]. Update the fourth triplet to be [max(2,5), max(5,2), max(5,3)] = [5,5,5]. triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[2,5,5],[5,5,5]].
The target triplet [5,5,5] is now an element of triplets.
 
Constraints:
1 <= triplets.length <= 105
triplets[i].length == target.length == 3
1 <= ai, bi, ci, x, y, z <= 1000


GREEDY NOT DISCUSSED WITH STUDENTS BUT IMPLEMENTED
Partition Labels, You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string "ababcc" can be partitioned into ["abab", "cc"], but partitions such as ["aba", "bcc"] or ["ab", "ab", "cc"] are invalid.
Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.
Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

Example 2:
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.

2. Lexicographically Smallest Palindrome, You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and you are allowed to perform operations on it. In one operation, you can replace a character in s with another lowercase English letter.
Your task is to make s a palindrome with the minimum number of operations possible. If there are multiple palindromes that can be made using the minimum number of operations, make the lexicographically smallest one.
A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
Return the resulting palindrome string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "egcfe"
Output: "efcfe"
Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "egcfe" a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is "efcfe", by changing 'g'.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: "abba"
Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "abcd" a palindrome is 2, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying two characters is "abba".

Example 3:
Input: s = "seven"
Output: "neven"
Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "seven" a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is "neven".

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
