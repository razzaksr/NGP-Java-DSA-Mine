Divide and Conquer:
Intersection of Two Arrays
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.

Constraints:
1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000



Koko Eating Bananas
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

Example 1:
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
Example 3:
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23

Constraints:
1 <= piles.length <= 104
piles.length <= h <= 109
1 <= piles[i] <= 109






GREEDY NOT DISCUSSED WITH STUDENTS BUT IMPLEMENTED
Partition Labels, You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string "ababcc" can be partitioned into ["abab", "cc"], but partitions such as ["aba", "bcc"] or ["ab", "ab", "cc"] are invalid.
Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.
Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

Example 2:
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.



Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples
In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted at every integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate (i, j) has |i| + |j| apples growing on it.
You will buy an axis-aligned square plot of land that is centered at (0, 0).
Given an integer neededApples, return the minimum perimeter of a plot such that at least neededApples apples are inside or on the perimeter of that plot.
The value of |x| is defined as:
x if x >= 0
-x if x < 0

Example 1:
Input: neededApples = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: A square plot of side length 1 does not contain any apples.
However, a square plot of side length 2 has 12 apples inside (as depicted in the image above).
The perimeter is 2 * 4 = 8.
Example 2:
Input: neededApples = 13
Output: 16
Example 3:
Input: neededApples = 1000000000
Output: 5040

Constraints:
1 <= neededApples <= 1015

Heart Rate Monitoring in Healthcare:
A wearable health device monitors a user's heart rate during exercise. To provide health insights, the device must track the highest heart rate over every 1-minute interval.
Problem Statement: Given an array heartRates[] and an integer k, find the maximum heart rate for each sliding window of size k.
Input1:
heartRates = [72, 80, 75, 90, 85, 92, 88]
k = 3
Output1:
Maximum heart rates for each sliding window:
[80, 90, 90, 92, 92]
heartRates = [70, 85, 60, 95, 82, 74, 90]
k = 2
Maximum heart rates for each sliding window:
[85, 85, 95, 95, 82, 90]
Window [70, 85] → max = 85
Window [85, 60] → max = 85
Window [60, 95] → max = 95
Window [95, 82] → max = 95
Window [82, 74] → max = 82
Window [74, 90] → max = 90

Defuse the Bomb
You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.
To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.
If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].
Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!
Example 1:
Input: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3
Output: [12,10,16,13]
Explanation: Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.
Example 2:
Input: code = [1,2,3,4], k = 0
Output: [0,0,0,0]
Explanation: When k is zero, the numbers are replaced by 0. 
Example 3:
Input: code = [2,4,9,3], k = -2
Output: [12,5,6,13]
Explanation: The decrypted code is [3+9, 2+3, 4+2, 9+4]. Notice that the numbers wrap around again. If k is negative, the sum is of the previous numbers.
Constraints:
n == code.length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= code[i] <= 100
-(n - 1) <= k <= n - 1


Given an array where each element represents daily sales revenue, and two integers k (window size in days) and X (target threshold), write a program to count how many contiguous subarrays of length k have a sum greater than or equal to X.
Real‑World Application:
- Retail: Detect sales streaks above a target.
- Finance: Count how many consecutive trading days meet profit targets.
- Healthcare: Monitor patient metrics (e.g., blood sugar readings) over fixed intervals.
- Manufacturing: Track production output over rolling windows to ensure quotas are met.
Example
- Input: sales = [2,1,5,1,3,2], k = 3, X = 7
- Output: 2
- Explanation: Subarrays [2,1,5] (sum=8) and [1,3,2] (sum=6, not valid), but [5,1,3] (sum=9) are valid. So total = 2.

Given an array where each element represents the daily defect count, and an integer k (window size in days), write a program to compute the average number of defects for every contiguous subarray of length k.
Real‑World Application:
- Manufacturing: Track rolling averages of defects or production output.
- Finance: Calculate moving averages of stock prices.
- Healthcare: Monitor patient vitals (e.g., blood pressure) over fixed intervals.
- Education: Compute average test scores over consecutive exams.
Example
- Input: defects = [1,3,2,6,-1,4,1,8,2], k = 5
- Output: [2.2, 2.8, 2.4, 3.6, 2.8]
- Explanation:
- First 5 days → average = (1+3+2+6+(-1))/5 = 2.2
- Next 5 days → average = (3+2+6+(-1)+4)/5 = 2.8
- And so on…







Variable:

Given an array where each element represents daily expenses, and an integer K (budget limit), write a program to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray whose sum is less than or equal to K.
Real‑World Application:
- Finance: Track longest streak of days staying within budget.
- Healthcare: Monitor longest period where patient vitals remain under safe thresholds.
- Retail: Find longest streak of days where sales discounts stay within a set limit.
- Manufacturing: Identify longest run of production batches where defect counts remain under tolerance.
Example
- Input: expenses = [2,1,5,2,3], K = 7
- Output: 3
- Explanation:
- Subarray [2,1,5] → sum = 8 (>7) ❌
- Subarray [1,5,2] → sum = 8 (>7) ❌
- Subarray [2,1] → sum = 3 (≤7) ✅ length=2
- Subarray [1,5] → sum = 6 (≤7) ✅ length=2
- Subarray [5,2] → sum = 7 (≤7) ✅ length=2
- Subarray [2,3] → sum = 5 (≤7) ✅ length=2
- Longest valid streak length = 3 (e.g., [2,1,5] trimmed to [2,1,5] before shrink gives 3).


Given a string where each character represents a customer ID, write a program to find the length of the longest substring that contains no repeating characters.
Real‑World Application:
- Telecom: Track longest streak of unique customer IDs in activity logs.
- Cybersecurity: Detect longest sequence of unique login attempts before a repeat.
- Healthcare: Monitor longest streak of unique patient IDs in a queue system.
- Education: Find longest sequence of unique student IDs in exam submissions.
- Retail: Identify longest streak of unique product codes scanned at checkout.
Example
- Input: "abcabcbb"
- Output: 3
- Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc".
- Input: "bbbbb"
- Output: 1
- Explanation: Only "b" is valid since all characters repeat.


Given an array where each element represents the number of patients admitted per day, and an integer target representing the minimum threshold of admissions, write a program to find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target.
Real‑World Application:
- Healthcare: Detect shortest period where patient admissions exceed capacity.
- Finance: Find shortest streak of days where expenses exceed a budget threshold.
- Retail: Identify shortest span of days where sales cross a target.
- Manufacturing: Track shortest run of batches where production output meets quota.
Example
- Input: admissions = [2,3,1,2,4,3], target = 7
- Output: 2
- Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has sum = 7, which meets the target with length = 2.
