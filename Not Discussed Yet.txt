Divide and Conquer:
Intersection of Two Arrays
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.

Constraints:
1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000



Koko Eating Bananas
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

Example 1:
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
Example 3:
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23

Constraints:
1 <= piles.length <= 104
piles.length <= h <= 109
1 <= piles[i] <= 109






GREEDY NOT DISCUSSED WITH STUDENTS BUT IMPLEMENTED
Partition Labels, You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string "ababcc" can be partitioned into ["abab", "cc"], but partitions such as ["aba", "bcc"] or ["ab", "ab", "cc"] are invalid.
Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.
Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

Example 2:
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.
